# UVicClassOpencingChecker
This program was created as a way for me to practice Java's syntax and the code is very messy.

**THE UVIC WEBSITE CHANGED AND THIS THING IS NOW BROKEN (unless it's not for some reason)**

It is intended to be run from the command line, with args[0] being the link to the course page
Ex: java checker "https://www.uvic.ca/BAN1P/bwckschd.p_disp_detail_sched?term_in=201901&crn_in=20623"
(it takes the waitlist into account as well)

In order to buld this you must include jsoup (I am using jsoup 1.11.3)
